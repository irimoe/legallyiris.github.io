## about

facet was a discord user app intended for plural systems to express themselves universally without requiring every server to have a plural bot

facet was abandoned as discord's user apps are far too limited to be useful for this purpose, it
would not have been able to provide a good experience for users and would have been a waste of time to
develop further
