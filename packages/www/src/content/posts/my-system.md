title: my system
description: about my experience with dissociative identity disorder, and the alters within my system.

living with dissociative identity disorder (or DID, as i will refer to it),
means that my mind is home to multiple different identities, each with their
own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. this is commonly referred to as a
"system," where each identity, or "alter," shares the same body but has
distinct perspectives, roles, memories, and etc. it's not something that's easy
to explain, but i'm going to try.

## what is a system?

a system is a group of people (or "[alters][alter]", "[headmates][headmate]",
"[plurans][pluran]," etc.), who share a single body, each with their own
personalities, preferences, and memories. in my case, my system includes
myself, iris, and willow. some systems may have many alters, others might only
have a few, but they key is that we're all part of the same shared experience,
even if our ways of thinking and feeling differ.

## how my system works

when an alter is controlling the body, that's known as [fronting]. in my
system, the alter that fronts the most is meâ€”iris. but there's also willow, who
has their own identity and preferences. we communicate with each other
internally, and we sometimes switch places (as in, switch who controls our
physical body, this is known as [switching][switching]), depending on which
alter is most comfortable in the current situation. it's like having multiple
different perspectives on the world simultaneously.

## dissociative identity disorder

[DID][did], previously known as multiple personality disorder, is often
misunderstood. it's a very complex condition that can develop due to things
like trauma during early childhood. DID is not about "having multiple
personalities" in the traditional sense, as it's previous name would suggest,
but rather a way for the mind to cope with overwhelming experiences by
creating distinct identities to manage different aspects of life. each
identity can be a coping mechanism, allowing the person to handle different
emotions and situations.
