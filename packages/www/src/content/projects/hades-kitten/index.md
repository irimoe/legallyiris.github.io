## about

Hades' Kitten is a discord bot for nationstates.net made by myself and a
friend,
[ArnavDevelops@github.com](https://github.com/ArnavDevelops).

the bot has several useful features for players, including a command to view a
nation's information, including economic data, political data, military data,
and etc. as well as integration with nationstates.net's server-side events, so
that players can have real-time updates on regional events in their discord
server.

there is also a comparison command that allows users to compare two nations'
data. a trade command is being worked on, see
[#7](https://github.com/Hades-Kitten/Hades-Kitten/issues/7).

Hades' Kitten also has a built-in, server-wide social network, named "Twatter",
which allows users to create accounts, make posts to a predefined channel, and
reply to other users' posts. Twatter also has tags for government
representatives, allowing users to distinguish between official and unofficial
posts. there are also notifications when you're tagged, your post is liked, or
when someone replies to your post.

## my part

in Hades' Kitten's development, i've contributed significantly to the project.
being wholly responsible for the development of Twatter, the built-in social
network, and i also rewrote it in typescript. i also wrote a shell.nix file for
nix users, and i also wrote a dockerfile for docker users, as well as a github
action workflow to build the docker image and publish it to the github package
registry.
