the modern nation-state - presented as the pinnacle of human organization - emerged as a response to the chaos and
violence of feudal society, promising order, services, and protection for its citizens. while states have indeed
provided crucial infrastructure, public services, and social safety nets that have improved many lives, when we examine
their function throughout history and in contemporary society, we see a more complex picture: one where these benefits
often come at the cost of exploitation, oppression, and systemic violence. the state is not merely a neutral provider
of services, but also acts as a tool for maintaining existing power structures and privileges.

## the illusion of democracy

western liberal democracies pride themselves on representing the _"will of the people"_ through electoral systems and
constitutional protections. however, this is a fa√ßade that hides the true nature of state power. the reality beneath
this veneer of democracy is far more sinister and complex.

the influence of corporate money and special interests has thoroughly corrupted the democratic process. in the United
States, the citizens united decision effectively legalised unlimited corporate spending in elections under the guise of
"political action committees", which has led to a system where politicians are beholden to their donors rather than
their constituents. in the United Kingdom, where I am _unfortunately_ from, conservative party donors have received
knighthoods, peerages, and government contracts worth billions of pounds in return for their financial support. this is
not democracy, but oligarchy. it ensures that policy decisions consistently favour the wealthy and powerful over the
needs of the general populace.

the revolving door between government and industry creates profound conflicts of interest that undermine any pre-tense
of democratic accountability. former ministers and officials routinely take up lucrative positions in the industries
that they once regulated, while corporate executives move into government positions, overseeing their former sectors,
this circular flow of personnel ensures that government policy aligns with corporate interests rather than public needs.

even the basic mechanics of democracy are designed to suppress genuine popular power. first-past-the-post voting
systems, employed by many western democracies, systematically marginalise alternative political perspectives and
entrench the power of dominant parties. in the United Kingdom, a party can win a majority of parliamentary seats with
barely a third of the popular vote - a far cry from the idea of _"one person, one vote"_. in the 2024 general election,
the Labour Party won 34% of the vote but 63% of the seats, while Reform UK won 14% of the vote, but only 1 seat (Reform
winning just 1 seat is a good thing, but the point still stands). in the United States, the two-party system effectively
locks out alternative voices. the electoral college further distorts the democratic process, allowing a candidate to win
the presidency without winning the popular vote, as happened in 2000 and 2016.

when people do attempt to exercise genuine democratic power through protest and direct action, the state reveals its
true nature through violence and repression. the militarisation of police forces, the criminalisation of protests, and
brutal suppression of social movements all demonstrate that the state power ultimately rests not on popular consent,
but on force. From the occupation of Zuccotti Park during the [Occupy Wall Street] Movement where police used pepper
spray and batons against peaceful protesters, obstructed press freedoms, and made baseless arrests to the violent
dispersal of [Black Lives Matter] protests and the Yellow Vest Movement in France, the state's response to dissent is
always the same: crush it and suppress it, by any means necessary.

## the marriage of state and capital

the modern state exists in a symbiotic relationship with capitalism, each reinforcing and legitimizing the other. states
enforce property rights that enable private accumulation of wealth, while their tax systems and monetary policies
facilitate upward redistribution. a prime example of this is after the 2008 financial crisis, where governments used
public funds to bail out the banks while millions of people lost their homes and jobs.

labour laws, ostensibly designed to protect the workers, often server to protect the interests of the employer instead.
in the United States, for instance, the [Taft-Harley Act] of 1947 severely restricted the power of unions, and workers'
ability to participate in solidarity strikes and secondary boycotts. police and military forces are routinely used to
protect private property and the interests of corporations, as witnessed during the [Standing Rock Protests] against the
Dakota Access Pipeline.

regulatory capture has become so prevalent that corporations effectively write their own rules. the revolving door
between regulatory agencies and the industries that oversee ensures that this continues - just look at how many former
Goldman Sachs executives have held high-ranking positions in the U.S. treasury department. meanwhile public resources
are becoming increasingly privatised for corporate profit, from the water systems in michigan and the United Kingdom to
the education system in chile.

## alternatives to the state

while many dismiss stateless organisation as utopian or impractical, there are real world examples of communities and
societies that have successfully organised without a centralised state, albeit with their own challenges and
limitations. the [Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities in Chiapas, Mexico], while facing ongoing pressure from the
Mexican state and economic constraints, have operated outside of state control for decades, maintaining their own
healthcare, education, and justice systems through democratic assemblies and rotating leadership positions.

Rojava, in northern Syria, has also implemented a system of [democratic confederalism], organising society through local
communes and their cooperative enterprises. their systems demonstrate how large-scale coordination can occur without a
centralised state power, particularly in their approach to ecological sustainability and gender equality.

while these two examples operate at relatively small scales compared to modern nation-states, they provide valuable
insights into how democratic, non-hierarchical organization can work in practice. the challenge lies not in whether
such systems can function, but in how to adapt and scale their principles to meet the needs of larger, more complex
societies.

on a smaller scale, modern worker cooperatives like [Mondragon] in Spain show how productive enterprises can operate
democratically without traditional capitalist hierarchies. with over 80,000 workers, Mondragon demonstrates that worker
ownership and democratic management can succeed at scale.

mutual aid networks have proven particularly effective during crises. during the COVID-19 pandemic, communities
worldwide organised to provide food, medical supplies and other essentials when the state failed to do so competently.
from [Food Not Bombs] to [Really Really Free Market], these networks show how communities can meet their needs through
voluntary cooperation rather than state mandates or capitalist exploitation.

the internet itself, in particular the fediverse, is a prime example of how complex systems can function through
federation rather than centralised control. platforms like Mastodon and the Matrix protocol demonstrate how social
communication can work without a corporate or state oversight, with peer-to-peer systems like torrents demonstrate
resilient resource sharing without central authority.

## the path forward

while the complete abolition of the state may seem distant or improbable, we can work towards reducing its power and
building alternative systems that empower communities and individuals. this process begins with the creation of dual
power structures - parallel institutions that provide for the people's needs outside state control. food co-ops,
community gardens, mutual aid networks, and worker cooperatives are all examples of structures that already exist and
can be expanded upon to challenge the state's monopoly.

strengthening local communities is crucial to this process. this means not just building physical infrastructure, but
fostering the social bonds and mutual trust that make genuine democracy possible. community assemblies, neighbourhood
councils, and other forms of direct democratic organisation can help people to learn to make decisions collectively and
manage their own affairs independently of the state.

the workplace is another crucial site of struggle. developing worker-owned alternatives to capitalist enterprises not
only provides economic democracy, but also builds the skills and relationships needed for broader social transformation.
worker cooperatives, community land trusts, and other democratic economic institutions demonstrate that production can
be organised without bosses or state control.

technology, particularly digital networks, offers possibilities for coordination without centralisation, though not
without challenges. while the fediverse demonstrates how communication platforms can be run democratically, it also
faces issues of scalability and content moderation. similarly, blockchain and peer-to-peer systems suggest
possibilities for managing resources collectively, but must address concerns about energy consumption and technological
accessibility.

perhaps most importantly, we must work to dismantle the systems of oppression that the state and capital use to maintain
their power. meaning actively opposing racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and other forms of
discrimination that divide working people and maintain hirearchies of power. it also means recognising how these systems
intersect with and reinforce state and capitalist power. we must be unflinching in our commitment to justice and
equality for all people, and to building a world where everyone can live with dignity and freedom.

the state is not a neutral arbiter of justice, nor is it a benevolent provider - it is a system of organised violence
that maintains hierarchies of power and wealth. by recognising this reality and working to build alternatives, we can
challenge the things as they are and work towards a more just, equal and free society where people cooperate as equals rather
than as subjects of authority.

while this transformation is not going to happen overnight, each step toward greater democratic and community control
is a step away from state and capitalist domination. the path is long and difficult, but it is a path worth taking.
the alternative is to continue down the road of exploitation and into a capitalist dystopia where the few hold even more
power over the many. the goal is _not_ to create chaos or isolation, but rather to build a society organised from the
bottom up, based on voluntary cooperation and mutual aid rather than coercion and exploitation.
